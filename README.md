# File-Destruction-self-d
A python based gui that allows one to quickly and seamlessly 
destroy any amount of data in the matter of seconds. Selfd is 
a python application that is meant 
to be a quick access file destruction tool.
!YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO ANY
DEVICE!
In order to use selfd simply place any file you 
wish to erase at any given time in the selfd folder.
When you wish to destruct the folder simply open the 
user friendly gui interface titled launch-self-d.py in 
python and click selfdestruct.
I highly sugest placing the selfdestruct gui in the selfd
folder to get rid of any evidence that you deleted something.
Please feel free to give me suggestions for my next python code!
Launch selfd is in its beta and will have many more features soon!
Selfd will also have a .exe file comming in the near future
Visit my you tube channel where i show how to code the base of selfd
